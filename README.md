# 📉 Portfolio Risk Analysis with Value at Risk (VaR) and Monte Carlo Simulation

## 🧠 Problem Statement
This project helps measure the risk of investment portfolios by calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using historical data and Monte Carlo simulations to predict potential losses.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🔧 Features
- Calculates historical VaR using percentile method
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate risk under different scenarios
- Visualizes risk distributions and confidence intervals

## 📈 Sample Output
*(Add a plot showing VaR distribution here if possible)*

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python portfolio_risk_analysis.py
